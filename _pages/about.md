Hi, my name is Elan Cooper. I am currently a junior studying computer science in New York City at Columbia University. I love playing basketball, modding video games, developing tools to legitimize the money I spend on PC building, and spending time doing yoga with [Kira Fox](https://www.instagram.com/trendyandbendy/).
