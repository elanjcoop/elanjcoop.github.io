Hi, my name is Elan Cooper. I am currently a junior studying computer science in New York City at Columbia University. I love playing basketball, modding video games, developing tools to legitimize the money I spend on PC building, and spending time doing yoga with [Kira Fox](https://www.instagram.com/trendyandbendy/).

Now let's look at some of my most prized projects. First up is my video game mod modeled after the real courts, jerseys, and players in my high school's Cooper Invitational Tournament (bonus shot of me in the middle).
